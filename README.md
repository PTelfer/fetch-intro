# APIs and how the Internet works

Every page on the internet is stored somewhere on a remote server.
When you type [www.github.com](https://github.com/) into your browser, a request goes out to GitHub’s remote server.
The server then sends a response.
Your browser, also known as the client, receives the response, interprets the code and displays the page.
This means that every time you visit a page on the Web, you interact with some remote server’s API.
An API is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It's a set of public methods and properties uses to interact with others via your application.

## Frontend, backend

The terms frontend and backend refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation
and the data that is permanently stored on the server.

The frontend code is also stored on the server but it is interpreted by the browser, the client.
